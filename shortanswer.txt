1. What is the difference between an API and a server?

A server is a computer that sends information over the Internet to client computers when it receives a request. An API, hosted on a server, is a collection of data that can be drawn upon to serve information to clients. It can also be used be developers to add functionality to their own applications.


2. What does a DNS server do when you type "www.google.com" into an address bar?

The DNS server takes that URL and matches it to the numeric IP address where the Google homepage is hosted. 

3. What are some differences between a single page application and a multipage application? List one example of each.

A single-page application can manipulate DOM elements based on user input without loading a new page, and can be built using technologies like AJAX and Node. A multi-page app uses the traditional request-response model, loading a new HTML page following each request from a client.

Wikipedia is a multi-page application, while Twitter (the timeline) is a single-page app.

4. Why do we use RESTful routes?

RESTful routes are important so that a browser can access information contained on a server without knowing in advance the structure of that data. 


5. What is an API key and why are they used?

API keys are unique codes given to developers by the creators of an API so that they can track its usage,
control who gets to use it, and set limits on its use by individual developers/third-party applications.
